Hello! Iâ€™m Riley
- I am currently a 6th year Graduate Research Assistant and PhD Candidate in the Psychology Department at the University of Cincinnati
-I started my post-secondary school education at the [University of Evansville](evansville.edu) in Evansville, IN receiving a B.S. in Cognitive Science (Computer Science Focus) and Philosophy with minors in Psychology and Neuroscience
- After Evansville, [Dr. Tamara Lorenz](https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/lorenztr) accepted me to be her first graduate student at the University of Cincinnati
- Together, our wide array of interests have led to work exploring many different topics all having something to do with how people act and navigate in their environment
- My research interests dabble into a little bit of everything, but the bulk of it investigates human movement through a Human Factors focus
  - I've conducted research in the past looking into...
    - Human Robot Interaction in both reality and virtual reality using a digital twin
    - [Human Ropot Interaction utilizing behavioral dynamics models to control robot behavior](https://doi.org/10.1145/3173386.3177022)
    - Creating an easier environment for novices with no programming experience to build Unity projects for research purposes
    - [Alternative feedback methods to improve prostheses](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2021.662397/full)
    - [How Virtual Reality can be used in rehabilitation](https://apta.confex.com/apta/csm2022/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/32278)
    - Coordinated dyadic movement
    - [Dyadic Energy Expenditure in coupled action](https://etd.ohiolink.edu/apexprod/rws_olink/r/1501/10?clear=10&p10_accession_num=ucin157106195472375)
  - My Dissertation is currently investigating...
    - How modulating information presentation in a virtual environment can lead to faster and better skilled action acquisition
  - Through these projects (and helping many others in my reserach lab), I have come to learn many different equipment systems, softwares, and skills
    - Lots of Virtual Reality work in Unity, mainly with the wireless HTC Vive Pro
    - Robotics programming and control via ROS (KUKA iiwa, Kinova Mico)
    - Motion Capture with Cortex from MotionAnalysis
    - Integrating our wireless VR systems with Motion Capture to embody and track research participants
    - Building and programming sensing apparatuses with microcontrollers 
    - Setting up and collecting physiological data using the BIOPAC system
    - Fusion360 to build and 3D print prototypes for my projects and others in my lab
    - Network communications and system setup
    - Scene world based Eyetracking headsets
  - Analysis Tools and Programming languages I'd consider myself dangerous enough to get in trouble with
    - Unity with C#
    - MATLAB (Nonlinear Analytical Methods)
    - R (Traditional Linear Analytical Methods)
    - Fusion360 (Parametric Modelling)
    - Arduino Uno
    - ROS (Python and C++)
- Outside of school, I have a few too many hobbies. Some notable ones are...
  - Turning wrenches in the garage on whatever is on jacks or on my workbench
  - Building furniture and shop equipment
  - Repairing and reselling previously broken tools and equipment on Craigslist
  - Helping my friends at Keystone Contracting and Remodelling if they have any big projects on the weekends
  - Dabbling in game development in Unity using the skills I've picked up from my research projects
  - Managing my home server and figuring out what else I can use it for
  - Designing and rapid prototyping tool and product ideas using Fusion360 and my 3D printer
  - Hiking East Fork State Park

I will be graduating with my PhD in Experimental Psychology with a focus in Human Factors by the end of Summer 2022 and am definitely looking for a job!
