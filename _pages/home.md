Over the past few years at the University of Cincinnati, my work has ranged from investigating the rate of energy expenditure in solo and dyadic tasks to training people skilled behaviors through implicit environmental manipulations in virtual reality. Using the cool tools we have in our research lab, I have had countless hours of experience using full body passive marker motion capture, virtual reality, embodied robots, machines to collect physiological metrics, and a whole lot more (often many of these simultaneously). 

My passion for Human Factors inspired design combined with my out of the box problem solving skills allows me to see solutions where others see a mountain of problems. Turning the system on its head often reveals an obvious answer and the vast skillset I have developed from my numerous hobbies gives me the tools to do just that. 

My main research interests exist somewhere in the space between Human-Robot Interaction, Virtual Reality Training, and intelligent design.
